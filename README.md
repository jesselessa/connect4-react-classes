## Stack

This project has been created with React using Vite.

It uses Class components (before React 16.8, it was the only way to track state and lifecycle on a React component).

## Main features

- **PvE Mode** : Play against an AI opponent with automated decision-making.
- **Dynamic Token Animation** : Realistic "drop" effect where tokens fall from the top of the grid to their position.
- **Visual Feedback** : The winning combination is highlighted with a pulse animation to clearly identify the end of the game.
- **Immersive Sound Effects** : Specific sounds for token drops, victory, defeat, and draw games.
- **Responsive Design** : The game board and UI adapt perfectly to mobile, tablet and desktop screens.
- **Game State Management** : Automatic detection of turns, victories, and stalemates with an easy reset option.
- **Background Music** : Integrated audio toggle for an enhanced gaming atmosphere.

## Game Rules

Challenge our computer opponent in this classic strategy game ! Here is how it works :

- **Man vs Machine** : This project is designed as a single-player experience where you face off against an AI.
- **Choose the Starter** : You decide who takes the first shot ! Select either "Player" or "AI" to start the game.
- **Your Colors** :
  - **You** : Play with the **Red** tokens.
  - **AI** : Plays with the **Yellow** tokens.
- **The Drop** : On your turn, click on any column to drop your token. The token will realistically fall to the lowest available space in that column.
- **The Objective** : Be the first to align **four** of your tokens in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally).
- **Winning & Draw** :
  - **Victory** : If you align four tokens, they will **highlight and pulse** with a victory sound.
  - **Defeat** : If the AI beats you, a failure sound will play.
  - **Stalemate** : If the grid is full with no winner, the game ends in a draw.
- **Restarting** : Use the **'Reset'** button at any time to clear the board and try a new strategy against the computer.
